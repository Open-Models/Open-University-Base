# Open University Knowledge Base

Overview of open models practices in universities. Knowledge base attempting to provide a state of the art around the notion
of « open university » based on open models (open science, open education, open software, open hardware, open data, etc.).
A tool to help understand and implement open models in universities.

Open science and open education are becoming more popular but are still in their infancy, along with all the other openness
dynamics having growing momentum. A whole range of open practices which are complementary to each other and which take
shape together, but these practices are still little understood and fragmented.

Phenomena that are likely to become more widespread given the direction of digital technologies, political choices and
the interests of the players involved.

Independent project in the context of the University of Geneva's initiative « [Towards a policy of openness to OER: State
of the art and perspectives](https://tecfa.unige.ch/proj/PolicyOER/) ».

Following & inspired by a (rejected) application on an [open education mission for a university](https://abcsxyz.github.io/open-education-mission/).

A form of research and development in relation to the project [Open Portal](https://portal.open-models.org).

**To be built**

## Topics

(Non-exhaustive) list of the kinds of topics to be discussed:

- Open models policies (at international, national and organisational level)
- Tools
- Education and training, maturity and awareness
- Funding
- New forms of organisation: Open Source Program Offices & Open Program Offices, factories/forge (OER, software...)

As many dimensions as possible to help us better understand what is already being done and what is possible around the
idea of open university. If there's anything you can shed light on, your contribution will be appreciated.
